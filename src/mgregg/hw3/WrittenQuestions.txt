Q1. Evaluating Sorting Algorithms:   <- ("Please run Q1.java to get these similar results for Q1")
    Q1.1:
        Algorithm				Stable Sort
        HeapSort: 	            false
        InsertionSort: 	        true
        MergeSort: 	            true
        QuickSort: 	            false
        SelectionSort: 	        false
        TimSort Primitive: 	    true
        TimSort Optimized: 	    true

    Q1.2
    	N			TimSort	Merge	PrimTS	Quick	Heap
       1048576		0.467	0.433	0.385	0.441	0.743
       2097152		0.653	0.686	0.677	0.914	1.840
       4194304		1.371	1.602	1.751	1.873	4.433
       8388608		3.130	3.584	3.887	5.292	10.458
      16777216		7.245	8.396	9.199	12.204	25.632

    Q1.3
    	N			TimSort	Merge	PrimTS	Quick	Heap
       1048576		0.203	0.241	0.253	0.324	0.691
       2097152		0.443	0.571	0.617	0.821	1.715
       4194304		0.833	1.305	1.392	1.951	4.029
       8388608		1.833	2.779	3.292	4.606	10.004
      16777216		4.340	7.264	7.901	11.967	23.484

      Answer: The runtimes are faster in all 5 of the sorting algorithms when we add more duplicate values at random.

    Q1.4
    	N			TimSort	Merge	PrimTS	Quick	Heap
       1048576		0.002	0.120	0.098	0.267	0.015
       2097152		0.008	0.255	0.202	0.646	0.031
       4194304		0.008	0.533	0.453	1.456	0.059
       8388608		0.017	1.101	0.929	3.853	0.119
      16777216		0.034	2.389	2.109	9.561	0.230

      Answer: These results are much faster than 1.2 and 1.3 which is really surprising.TimSort is really fast in 1.4
              because of it's unique sorting based off of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. Heap sort is also really fast.
